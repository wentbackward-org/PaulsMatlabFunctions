* Paul's Matlab Functions

A bunch of useful functions I've written. I'll add them slowly, as I document and create tests for them. Most of them should work with scalars or vectors. Some may work with matrices (if it makes sense). I have these in a folder added to my matlab path.

** Financial
    These functions are quick to calculate loan and investment payments. They all assume an annualised 
    rate, compounded monthly and the periods expressed in months.
    - PMT - Loan payment calculator.
    - FV - Future value, or the total amount of a loan you pay including interest.
    - FVpayment - Future value of a fixed monthly payment.
    - PV - Present value, or how much you need to invest now.
    - PaymentSchedule - capture the payment schedule of a load.
** Utilities
    - s - Show a number [vector or matrix]. Does matlab drive you crazy having to fprintf everything, just use `s'.
    - columns_in - Tells you how many decimals before the point.
** Examples
>> s([amounts; PMT(amounts,2.5/7,48); PMT(amounts, 2.57,60); PMT(amounts, 2.57,120)], 0)
